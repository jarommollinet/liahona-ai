    answer: `Your question about "${question}" is a thoughtful one that many people ponder. In the Book of Mormon, we find insights in several passages.\n\nAlma teaches us that "faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true" (Alma 32:21).\n\nMoroni further invites us to "remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts" (Moroni 10:3).`,
